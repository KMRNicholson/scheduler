# scheduler-webapi

The goal of this app is to provide the UNB student with the tools to synchronize and centralize all of their school needs. This is simply the back-end for storing user related data such as courses, assignments and appointments. The goal is to also use the API provided by D2L and UNB's portal website to retrieve class schedule information and information on assignment due dates.

This is still in early design phase and is mostly something I am playing around with to further my understanding of the asp.net web api framework. Cheers!
